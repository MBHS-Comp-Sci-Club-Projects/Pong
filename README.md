## Introduction

Pong is one of the first video games ever created. In this implementation, players control paddles and try to bounce a ball past the opponent's paddle to score points.

## Gameplay

The game consists of two paddles and a ball. The ball moves across the screen, bouncing off the walls and paddles. Players score a point each time the ball passes the opponentâ€™s paddle.

- **Player 1** controls the left paddle.
- **Player 2** controls the right paddle.

The game continues until either player reaches a winning score.

## Setup

To play the game, you need **Python** and the **Pygame** library installed.
